That is the reason they might have put 4 gb ram phone on sale.

Note: The review is for 4gb 64gb rom.

Pros:
Light weight
Good screen
Gaming is also fine tested few casual game and Marval Contest of champions which runs smooth....

2) Camara outdoor is kind of fine but night photography will be nightmare for this phone
3) Performance for normal tasks no issues

I hope realme will rectify the issue and may be patch this issue with any OTA update . (Expected)

I'm also tired with the google dialer , it notifies the callers if the call is getting recorded everytime . But we have to get used to it ,...

There is not much to say about this one.

The Camera is Mediocre and don't expect anything crazy from this camera.
Front camera is good for occasional selfie as it lit up the scene through AI.
UI is good enough.
Charger is fast enough.
Doesn't support 5G.
Don't expect great gaming experience from this. Play on medium settings okay.

Actually I bought it for my mother and she is having zero problem with it. I personally don't thin...

Received mobile in 2 days. We are happy. First time I purchased the Realme product.

Camera: 4/5

I have Redmi Note 8 and compared both the Cameras.

1. Redmi Note 8 is taking a clear picture whereas Realme does not.
2. Realme shows extra brightness (over colors) while taking pictures
3. In zoom, Realme picture is the worst

Colour: 3.5/5

1. Phone color (purple) is not that much which is shown in the Flipkart images.
2. In real, the phone color is very lite and dull.

Size: 5/5

Pros: Everything
Cons : I think Google apps like Google classroom and crome not optimised perfectly as I face a little bit of delay it might be due to internet but in classroom the voice goes a little high and low and I don't know why . Rest all is perfect the charging is also quick and battery too . Camera also very nice and software also . I haven't seen any ad yet .
