I realised the problem while playing Pubg mobile and using a 8x 6x 4x and 4x scope. We tend to move a little when scope is opened to adjust the target but it doesn't respond to slight movement so you can't shoot right.

The most advertised feature of this phone itself is the con of the phone.
1. The screen freezes when trying to record in 4k (30fps) or FHD (60fps)
2. Slow Motion function not working
3. If using the camera app for photos or video recording the system gets slow and throws out of the app.

Battery : The claim of the company that battery lasts for 2 days is fake since the battery lasts for about 1 day and 6 hours max in normal usage.
Heavy weight : Although the phone is quite heavy, but due to its immense large size, it looks decent. Also, you can use it one handedly.

1209,3,"It's performance is not so good as the expectation was high due to the specification of this device. 108MP camera is not really 108, I assume, because the quality is similar in both, in normal mode and high resolution. Though I am giving 3 rating as you can't get more in this range of 16K. Something will be lacking in all device."

Not worth in view of battery slow charging and heating which is most important nowadays for mobile."

All the other this are ok."

1225,3,Camera 108mp it compare to 64mp
1226,3,Over weight due to large battery
1227,3,"Moto G60 is a good phone. But buying it with replacement policy is a concern especially from flipkart.

When you have some problem with the device, don't even think about the replacement. The replacement policy is just for namesake. If you do not worry about replacement policy, it is the best phone available in the market for now."

1343,3,Ok.

1352,3,Expected a better product.

Otherwise everything fine"

Not fast charger

Not handy
No good call recordeder"
1358,3,"Has screen touch issues. Ghost touch, sudden unresponsive screen etc."

1362,3,The Battery Is Not Good it is draining fast
1363,3,"This phone price is good but it's functional is not good and there is no app lock, mobile app lock is not good u install all the app outside"
1364,3,"All expectations are collapsed, no dual app option, poor quality pictures and 48MP is better than this, no read mode option, no dedicated sim slot."

1366,3,Phone is good but camera is not as per configuration everything is good In phone

1368,3,"Camera is normal, battery backup is good
Display is very bad"
1369,3,The product is excellent in each & every aspect but the price has been reduced just next day after my purchased...it is shocking unpredictable and not good for your regular customers...otherwise everything is OK.
1370,3,Front camera is. Not good
1371,3,",not bad"
1372,3,I love motorola
1373,3,Camera with a poor camera.
1374,3,Camera is just ok..other wise phone good
1375,3,I've used Asus Max M1 prior to this phone. A lot of it is in comparison to that and one month of usage for this one. 6GB of ram is a waste since saw apps crashing and not responding multiple times. Android 9 was better in experience than Android 11. Network coverage was better in Asus M1 ( for the same sim card ). Only good thing is the sturdy feel and Stock Android (compared to other brands).. overpriced in this segment. 108 MP camera is just a marketing gimmick. Screen is also oversized.
1376,3,Overall mobile is good in this price.
1377,3,Everything is good but camera really disappointed 😞 me
1378,3,The camera is not good and for same price remaining competitors are giving good camera.
1379,3,Camra quality is not good ..

1382,3,Delivery was on time and products is also good.
1383,3,"Camera is not good as I expected
Some software mistakes still persist like call waiting and call merger, some applications not working properly, audio issues, weight and thickness is not good etc

Still g60 is good bcz these are some software mistakes however hardware is good, running good, process good, screen good, tuch and finger sensor good n all"
1384,3,Nice
1385,3,"Moto g60 has no setting to see real time network speed in notification that's very hard to know our network working well or not.!
Also need camera improvement.if you click photo in night same image in 2-3shots they all are different. Bluetooth connectivity is poor. Very disappointed ☹️ version of motorola. Also battery 🔋 is not work like 6000mah. It's drain very fast at 100 to 60."
1386,3,"Good package overall, but without a good camera. Photos are below average. My nokia 7.2 used to capture far better, clear and crisp pics with its 48mp cam. Other than the camera, no complains till now. Pic clickers should avoid this phone ..."
1387,3,Not happy with it for sure.
1388,3,Camara not very good not for 108 pixel clarity

1394,3,"Very slow phone , images download very slow , download manager unsuccessful showing while downloading something,"
1395,3,Worst mobile ever hangs a lot like lag even after the update camera 108 is like 12 px camera yeah battery is great no question there.
1396,3,"Mobile is hanging alot..
Don't buy this mobile"
1397,3,"Camera-- - Ok. Ok .. just don't click good snaps against harsh sun..

G dialler -- Observed hanging issue while merging calls . Also observed delay (min 5 secs) in responding ,connecting calls post pickup

Battery -- ok .lasts for 1 day of normal usage ( excluding games )

Stock android -- I personally found nor user-friendly ..No dedicated files /folders to store stuffs .. also zip file issue observed

Rest all ok ..as per daily general use .."
1398,3,Slow processing device hangs many time
1399,3,"In day light, selfie camera and rear camer, both are amazing..
night vision feature is less than expectations... Zoom camera, micro lens both gives worst experience.
Battery is 6000 MAH but performance of battery is less than 4000MAH...I have to charge battery 2 times in a day.
Motorola has no Gallery.
If you are getting this phone under 15000, only then, you should buy.
3/5 rating"
1400,3,Avg camera...not even matching to moto x play
1401,3,"Battery Back up is good, Display & Both of Front & Rear Camera is not so good. Mobile isn't worth for money."
1402,3,Price is to high
1403,3,"Reason I bought this phone is clean os without bloatware. Rest of the department functions are average. Phone hangs. Every now and then. If Motorola didn't improve their quality, soon they will fade away completely from market."

1405,3,"Battery backup 👌👌👌👌...
Camera, charging, 👌👌👌.

Only i dislike is the announcement of call recording. And no call forwarding option seen"
1406,3,Overall it's Value for money phone.very clean experience with stock android.only issue is no fast charging. For such large battery atleast 33 watt charging is must. It's a quiet heavy in terms of weight.
1407,3,Okay
1408,3,Nice
1409,3,108@ camera Poor performance
1410,3,"Do not buy it ,camera is not good"
1411,3,It's ok
1412,3,"Cons
Phone is so thick and feels over weighted, can understand it has 6000mah battery but still feeling like holding a piece of brick in hand with back case
And camera quality is worst, it doesn't seem like 108MP, 13mp camera would perform better than this.

Pros
Battery backup is good lasts upto 1 and half to 2 days.
Display quality look good,
Performance wise no issue, stock andriod experience is good."
1413,3,"Decent phone. However like most moto phones it hangs every now and then. Secondly, different apps open, even when not touched. Lastly, the Bluetooth app does not work smoothly."
1414,3,Ok
1415,3,Some time hang
1416,3,Having 108MP camera but its not worth.. Photo quality looks like it having just 24MP camera. Phone lags.. Im not a gamer. Just installed 13 apps. Worst.. Dont go for this product..

1430,3,Motorola g60 has many issue like 108 mega pixel of camera is not working ... Screen problem also we have... I think flipkart send one copy of mobile because when we unboxing seal are broken and some sticker stuck on it ...
1431,3,"Camera is waste, Very worst photos. If any one by for camera u going to waste the money."
1432,3,"Great looks, great performance bt the camera sucks!

1472,3,"I have been using this from last 1 month and immediate observations are:
- The camera quality is very average. Doesn’t justify 100+mega pixel camera.
- Battery is good and overall performance is also great. No complaints on that.
- Phone is bit on the heavier size to carry and if you add a flip cover to it then the weight is very noticeable
- look wise the phone design is excellent, liked the overall design. Only flip side is the plastic cover at the back.
- OS is quite fast and responsive.

Not pocket friendly
It comes with back case, better to order tempered glass while you buy this phone sabit is not available in market..
Disappointed with the weight and thickness of the phone"
1776,3,Camera performance is very very poor....
1777,3,"Value for money. Decent performer, games run smooth. Camera performs well in well-lit conditions. Moto actions are very handy.
Battery lasts a good 1½ to 2 days with moderate usage with the 6000 mAh battery. On the downside, the phone feels very heavy, but sadly that's the way all the manufacturers are going."

1779,3,Rear Camera quality low it's not 108 mg pixel camera
1780,3,Camera is not worth it
1781,3,Lot of bug's. Waiting for software updates
1782,3,Camera result is not good as it has 108mp. And quality of camera picture is poor . But display is running smooth.
1783,3,Camera is worst and it heats up while you are using the camera meanwhile display response is good
1784,3,Not bad
1785,3,108mp camera is bad. Other cameras are fine. But camera app is bad. Image processing is bad. Image loading time is more. 6000mah battery is just giving one day of usage with 60hz. With 120hz it will not last for one day. Compass sensor is not available. Actually compass is needed. The charger supplied with the mobile might damage the battery very soon. I think now a days companies are considering like we use a mobile for only one year.
1786,3,108 mp camera not worth
1787,3,"The device is amazing and smooth. The camera and performance is good but there are a lot of bugs with network. I cannot send sms most of the time, it shows error 0. Also not able to turn off sim from network settings. It becomes really frustrating sometimes when you are waiting for an otp or someone's message"

1789,3,Poor speaker output. Very poor display of colours for vedeos and photos. Even cheap model redmi phones have better performance

1791,3,"The screen is huge but lacks the crispness. Atleast a samoled equivalent screen would have been a value for money.
Phone is fast battery is good.
But if you are looking for a phone to watch OTTs, this is not for you. Even the sound quality on earphone when compared to my Samsung M30 is too bad.

Not worth the money you spend.
Choose wisely."

Its too big
Screen guard is not provided.
20w charger is not adequate to charge 6000ma battery

Display must have amoled instead of LED in comparable range."

Even the camera 108MP is not up to the mark. I think update will help me
Selfie camera is very nice 32MP enjoyed taking photos.
Motorola has nailed it. they can take over MI phones with this kind of price waiting for more new phone of Motorola."

Battery is average.

Performance is very good if you use without any other launcher. But will lag sometime if use launcher. I am using Microsoft launcher because it provide app hide option without rooting mobile.

Hope it will not disappoint me for further 1-2 years."

2108,4,"Honest Review after 1 month. Moto brand name is very good, but don't fully trust on this brand name, as G60 provides 108 mp camera but actually it's not looking like that. Image quality is not upto the mark, it could be more better than the actual quality. Macro is worst. Blur effect is looking good but if you zoom it then it will looks worst. Battery life is very very good. Set is bit hardy, overweight. Call clarity, touch, display is good with 120hz refresh rate. Don't hangs, works smoothly...

2109,4,"Charges faster but on data switched on discharge rate is ok , runs well for 1.5 days. Camera quality is good in both low light and full light but appears grainy when it is trying to capture full resolution.
Phone is a bit bulkier side. Comfortable in hand. Fingerprint scanner is fast. And comes with stock Android so ui works well overall a budget friendly phone."

If you are clicking a picture in high resolution mode you need to hold the capture button few seconds, then you will get a good picture. Image gets pixalated after u zoom. 108MP camera doesn't give you what is expected. Except camera it's all good"

2. Design is not good looking.
3. Mobiles thickness is more looks bulky.
4. Camera is good but it's not like 32 mp and 108 mp it's decent.

Overall mobile is good in working but now days design of mobile also matters so it's really thick. Looks big fat phone.

2460,4,"1)camera is good,not super.but there is an ultra res mode in camera which is the 108 megapixel camera mode I think and it gives superior near 20 megabyte photos of great quality .this mode is not suitable for snapping fast movements. Of course if you are a camera fan, then definitely you will not complain as no mobile phone camera can match a dslr or mirrorless cameras.
2)battery is good enough, but it may be due to the fact that the screen is led and not samoled.some videos can be zoomed to...

May be I'll put a review after one week use. Haven't explored it's full features yet. but loving it for many other features.

2627,4,"It doesn't feel heavy on my hand though technical it sounds. I feel like a light device only.

Camera have potential to give stunning results, I'll give 3.8/5. Rest 1.2 can be achieved by further software optimization by moto updates.


Stock android is peaceful. Gallery is missing. Within 2 days you'll feel comfortable with the UI.

Reason justified for why I bought this:

For long lasting performance and durability.

Camera : Camera Performs Well In Natural Light Conditions but camera degrades in artificial light conditions and performs horrible.So camera is 3/5.

Performance: It's quite good, I play Genshin Impact and it runs on 30fps in low-med settings.

Battery: It is good, an average user who doesn't play games can easily run for 2 days with single charge on 60hz. But keep in mind it's only 20watt charger so it takes time to charge 2hrs.

Display: I Have No Com...

In this price range it's really good. Sound and speakers are good too! It's a great phone. Good job Motorola. But only bring about...

Great phone with the great price package."

There are lots of new features in this phone but I feel it's lagging sometimes may be I am feeling this because I was using one plus 6 prior. Overall it's value for money."

2744,4,So far mobile is gud.
2745,4,Everything about the phone is good except the duel app in whatsapp. When taking the duel WhatsApp lot of ads coming and delays opening it which irritates the user.

Battery having issue as it only works on standby mode if you want tou use it for full day.
Display having latency issue and its get rugged fast. As on my phone display rugged mark is placed in only 3 months. It's means it's not long life.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2757,4,One of best performing phone in the range. Camera and display are decent. The screen backlight is rather low that may cause visibility issue in sunlight.
2758,4,"I only bought it because it has network aggregation and passed the durability tests. Obviously it's not waterproof and the cameras are not that perfect. But 108 MP, long battery, network aggregation and high durability makes it a great purchase in that price range. Believe me it's way more durable than it's counterparts....."

2778,4,"Very good phone indeed. No worry of bloatware. For large display likers, it is an excellent phone. Battery performance is excellent, but charging is a bit slower. It is not a major constraint. Of course, I am not a gamer, but even on long use, I don't find any heating problem. Even with single speaker , the sound is harmonious. In low light conditions the camera performance is not satisfactory. If the phone is provided with latest version of Corning Gorilla glass , Super amoled display and...

2792,4,"Initially I was bit hesitant about choosing Moto, but decided to go for it. There is no much difference between G40 and G60. You can choose G40 over this. The phone is bulky because of huge battery. Charging speed is low ( can say very average). The phone operation is smooth. More than one mo th of usage and didn't find any issue.

Camera are average. But it is realistic. Not enhances anything like Redmi or other brand in this segment."

Camera interface shakes while taking pictures, video has stabilization though. Pictures come out nicely without any saturation, one might not like the pics if used redmi, realme camera previously.

2870,4,"not for camera lover ..108 camera is just a myth...by default it takes only 42 MP photo...camera pictures quality not as expected..but I think in this price range and with this configuration you can ignore that expectation...


battery charging is taking too much time as compare to other phones but long lasting for atleast 2 fully days if you are average user.

display feels good but... in darks..watching movie is hard due to low brightness..I also feels sometimes some software issue in touch...

This phone has an awesome battery backup, with no advertisements or bloatware installed. The software experience is total bliss.

3181,4,"It's a decent phone for its price. It doesn't have a built in Parallel Apps feature like OnePlus where you can use WhatsApp with two different numbers. You can do using different Apps like Multi Parallel, but they contain a lot of ads. Hopefully they should introduce it via software update.

Apart from that, the phone would meet the expectations for its price."
3182,4,One of the best if not the best phone in this price.

3204,4,I like the mobile. We can add more than one finger prints. Camera is also good. Torch light gets activated with the jerk which is a cool feature that can be used during an emergency. But the mobile is missing a dedicated slot for memory card.
3205,4,"Good mobile with very good specs. Camera is OK. Everything else is just fine. It is a big mobile, so be prepared for the size.
Pros: Very good specs. Big 6000MAh battery, USB C. Near stock Android; received with Android 11 updated in Mar 2021. Regular updates will be available. No bloatware (Facebook can be uninstalled)
Cons: Big size (6.9""), Charger should have been more powerful considering battery capacity, Hybrid sim slot, Camera is average."
3206,4,"Reviewing after using for a month. Firstly happy to see that it's made in India. At this price it's excellent phone. Have been using Moto for last many years. This time also it didn't disappoint me. Pros: Battery last for minimum 2 days when kept in continuous usage. Display is perfect. Camera quality is great. Taking screen shot and sharing made very simple and easy. Overall, front and back look is smart.

3214,4,"Pros: Ad free experience,battery life,good hardware.

Cons:
1) Not good camera. Don't think about good quality just by looking at 108 mp. Front camera is bad as well. Motorola really needs a camera upgrade in terms of software.
2) phone is very big,bulky, heavy. My father has galaxy m51. That has 7000 mah battery. This moto g60 has 6000 mah battery. Still this is bigger, fatter than m51.

Note: (most important)
If you are unhappy after using the phone, you can't return it. I mean you will no...

Cons- The removal of navigation buttons create confusion sometimes. There are a lot of functions which are not written anywhere and the manual given is completely useless"
3241,4,"After 10 days usage :

I think with phone size really disappointed as hardly can operate with single hand, yes, I know battery size is big and resulted big in size and able to survive two days easily with one time charge.

Camera is good but not among the best ones out there. Again, with it's price tag, you can't really complain about getting the best aspects in all areas. If you aren't camera-obsessed this phone is really among the best ones in the market rn. Its 4.5/5 for me!"

It is genuine review, I like this phone, it is safe than mi nd realme because of close to stock android with thinkshield , it's software better than other brands at this price point.

3353,5,"Camera quality is awesome see my uploaded pictures, there is a naturalness in the photos unlike mi phones, which makes your face like you have just done a makeup, all pics were taken in low light evening. Don't go on utube reviews, battery charge within 50 minutes. I like new GUI and gestures while surfing going back and so forth."
3354,5,"I am writing this review after 37 days of rigorous use. I am not a gadget freak of any kind but I got wary of using these redmi phones. I desperately wanted to change my brand of smartphone. I bought this phone after weighing a lot of other options & so far I am highly impressed by this phone & i think Motorola has done a commendable job in making this mid range beast of a phone. I also read a lot reviews before buying this phone. A lot of people complained about phone's weight, charging time...

3356,5,"I got this phone under 24hr after ordering.
Everything is great for me except for display. Display brightness is low and har to see in daylight. Games are running smooth with 120hz display, is amazing experience. Camera is great at this price range.
And the most important thing that i loved the most about this phone is stock android. If you dont want to add to see any ads or blootware then this is the great choice."
3357,5,"Good specs at too good price. Screen size 6.8 inch fits in your palm. Good features, clean android. Camera clarity is good for normal use. Handset feels sturdy unlike oppo or vivo, but doesn't feel bulky. Speaker is loud enough. IPS LCD display is good enough for day to day use. Not lagging so far, hope Snapdragon processor maintains the goodwill. Memory is good, internal memory expandable, but with hybrid slot. 6000MAH battery with 20w charger takes 2 hours to charge upto 100%, but lasts for...

Everything looked good in this G60 phone as I was expecting. Long battery, good performance and good battery. Two things I have to mention which are not met my expectations.

3359,5,"-We all know about the pros, just let me tell you very few cons that are with this device:
Firstly, no magnetometer and compass. Google maps work fine bt you can't risk taking this device if you travel a lot to hilly places and go for trekking etc.
-Secondly, the primary camera performs very well and 108mp is great too bt the image quality in macro is just average. You can enhance camera quality by installing Gcam.
-You get security update every 3-4 months.
Apart from these, this is the best...

Pros:
1. Excellent Camera quality
2. Super performance
3. Big battery life gives almost 2 days battery backup on normal use.
4. Decent display
5. No heating issue while playing games

Cons:
1. Only concern is the width of the phone. As per the height of the phone width should be little bit more. At the time of viewing movies or videos in full-screen the top and bottom visuals will missed out.

Apart from this issue I don't have any problem with this phone. B...

I AM SHARING AFTER USING 2 DAYS THIS MOBILE PHONE MOTO G60

Pros big screen, big battery ,camera, 732 sd, front flash.
Cons, (big screen N/A), MIGHT BE SCREEN LIGHT, CAMERA MAY NOT BE ABSOLUTELY 108 BUT STILL IT IS VERY MUCH EFFECTIVE AND NICE PICTURE QUALITY.

DO NOT LOOK FOR 1-2-3-4 STAR RATING BELEIVE IN 5 STAR RATING ONLY...... YES THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN BUDGE....."
3363,5,"The first thing that will come to anyone's mind will be weight😂. I was very very sceptical in the beginning, when I haven't received the product. But I have to say the weight distribution is very very good. I had tried many mobiles near 200g weight but none of them could match it's level. It is very very comfortable to use and you won't feel it's weight unless compared side by side or you are switching from light weight phone.
1. The battery department is excellent. The charging is slow in ...

3364,5,"Hello everyone,
First things first. This review is for anyone who has a 50-50 mindset for this phone, just like I had. I'm a Samsung fan and have bought G60 for my Father
- Camera _ Daytime it is outstanding for a midranger device. It crops the images at final outcome, but the end result is very nice at this price point. Night shoot is equally good but compromises a little on image detail and sharpness
- Chipset _ Snapdragon is hands-down the top performer. Moto has given the fastest 7 series...

3365,5,Everyone who's saying camera is bad well in daylight conditions photos are awesome you just have to take a perfect shot not just point and shoot... And for other things this phone is phenomenal
3366,5,I can give 10/10 bec. It fulfilled my all expectations. firstly battery is awesome it can run 2 days on single charge. Secondly display of phone is excellent as it friendly with eyes you can use 3-4 hours continuosly without irritation.Thirdly processor is very fast & Camera is also good & lastly value for money.
3367,5,"Nice phone great built quality and works very smooth.
Based on usage every thing works quite good
Battery awesome backup
Screen refresh rate is also great no lags and no issue while plying heavy games like asphalt 9 legends and PUBG.

the only thing i dont like so much is camera
Is just good for use but not great as written 108mp is just like 32mp rear camera. Come to selfie is good and nice quality of selfies

So overall its a great phone for gamers those who play whole day."
3368,5,"Best Motorola handset in this much low price, phone is smooth little bulky just because of battery and it is worth being bulky long lasting battery backup, screen so wide and large really enjoys watching videos and playing games, smooth processor never hangs , camera quality is upto the mark as mentioned really loved the product you should definitely go for this !"
3369,5,"Very butter smooth performance and a big screen....
If your priority is bigger screen smooth and fast performance and clear Android then this is for you...If you need a photo which makes monkey to a princess then this phone is not for you...It gives you natural photo ."
3370,5,"I loved these 3 things
1) Good Display
2) Good feel in hand
3) Clean OS and useful features

I didn't like these 3 things
1) Poor back camera (maybe software optimization problem)
2) Heavy to hold after extended period of usage
3) Less availability of accessories (not a deal breaker)"
3371,5,"I've been using the phone for two weeks now. It's amazing. Camera is awesome. Delivers good experience. Gestures are great support.

Cons : it heats up in between. Especially during call. Rest all is awesome"
3372,5,"Good Camera Clarity but can improve camera level more.
Battery and other performance is good"
3373,5,"Awesome device: (Shifted from iPhone SE 2020 to Moto G60)

-> Screen is great (No difference in actual usage in between an LCD and LED) and the 120Hz screen works super smooth :D
-> Stock android experience at this price! 0 bloatware (only 2-3 Motorola apps that are useful)
-> Battery life is awesome: kept at 120Hz (not auto) still, it gives 30+ Hrs of battery
-> Played basic games: works awesome
-> Camera is also good for normal usage
-> Looks and feels very good"
3374,5,"Worth considering at this price
Especially for its software experience and clean UI.
Camera is good and although the screen is an Ips display it's of great quality. Battery performance is also superb especially due to its clean UI."
3375,5,"Very good product in budget...
Use one week battery backup is very good, awesome looking and great performance. I like so much"
3376,5,Nice phone and thankyou so much flipkart for getting me the best offer with an option to exchange the old one... This one is a nice phone..i also read reviews here on flipkart and decided to go for it..

Battery pick up is very high
Weight 220 gram but feeling in hand like that 190 gram
Feature is awesome
Very nice processure"
3379,5,"In this price range, I only expect good performance with good battery backup and a clean interface, which Motorola always provides. This time the camera is also decent and newly added moto features are cool..."
3380,5,Good phone. Worth the money. Camera is good for still photos . Moving object photos are a disaster. Battery life last 1.5 days on average use. Slightly bigger size and slightly heavier than most phones. Good performance.
3381,5,A very good mid range phone though all features are quite good but not great. However if you are a fan of a clean UI experience especially without ads and with stock android. You have taken the right choice to go with Moto G60.
3382,5,"Smooth performance, I using this from a week.
Cam not yet tried apart from that everything is so good.
I played pubg too, with full battery we can play 4 hours n more without lag. After 4hours it will automatically send u out 😂🤣 so I'm not sure how many hours we can play...
Pro : battery backup and stock android
Cons : bit heavy compare to other mobiles but not a problem to me

If u r looking for battery backup n normal player like tympass one u can buy this...
Loads love ❤️❤️❤️"
3383,5,"Excellent choice if not an intense gamer. The camera quality is decent and the battery life is best, for a heavy user like lasts for a day or two. This phone is perfect for this range as it offers the best of flagship with some adjustments."

Really recommended smartphone.. literally op
3385,5,The mobile is best in segment and battery is very good it goes to like 3-4 days when not in use but you have to charge 1 or 2 times to make it better camera is good and spot colour is very good and performance is very good

120 Hz refresh rate awesome experience
Full HD + large display (brilliant)
Face unlock (secure & Fast)
Fingerprint quick response
Need some improvement in camera portion
Front camera is excellent for selfies"
3388,5,"Initially I thought I wouldn't like this phone, but my perspective has been changed completely. It's an excellent choice besides Redmi-note 10pro max, coz this one has stock android which ultimately out performs competent phones.
Pros:
1) though it's an IPS Lcd it's a good quality one, good colour reproduction.
2) clean software experience with stock android, no ads and bloatware.
3)Added moto features are 👌you'll simply love them trust me.

Nowadays it's hard to find a clean android with oppo mi etc

Worth for money.
Batter than Chinese phones like Vivo, Oppo etc..."
3394,5,"*Overall product is decent.*
Camera is a big concern I feel. Old Mi camera is far better than this. So no comparison with Mi phone of this range.
Gaming performance is also not upto mark, at times it stops working.
Display is good.
Some features are good like DND activation, Notification history, theme customisation, etc.
But, I would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for a camera phone , better go for Poco X3 pro which also has a better processor."
3395,5,"Very good/Best phone in this price range. Compared to Redmi note 10 pro, since it has Amoled display, there is some heating issues and also it is not balanced properly like auto brightness. But in this everything is well balanced, In all aspects, like call quality, Haptic Touch. Addition to that battery life is in to next level."

3556,5,"""Fantastic phone""
Using this mobile G 60 from last one week and there is no problem in the product. I think Motorola is a big name and they will never give wrong or sub-standard product to their customers. I am fully satisfied with the product. Motorola should provide atleast two more things with their mobile 1. Tempered Glass 2. Ear phones because when company will give with their product that will be a good quality product."
3557,5,Be happy
3558,5,"Great Phone.
Nice Display.
Decent Battery Life.
Added Security Features.
Good Interference.
Good Camera With Various modes.

And most importantly You can control the permission of every apps in your phones. And at the same time Motorola also Blocks suspicious & unwanted permission on priority basis."

It is quite long in hand. Though it has very good feeling in hand but it would look better and easy to carry if the length is bit small. Overall I must say it is worth buying."

3808,5,"1. Overall handset look wise no comments, when you hold the phone you feel the power of brand, Yes it's bit heavy, but you will proud to hold the phone.
2. UI is decent.
3. Camera 📸, would like to say even if we pay 35k and above you will get only 3x optical zooming be it one plus, samsung and other brands etc.... So, we can't expect DSLR clarity. At this price the features which we have is awesome to use and enjoy the clarity."
3809,5,Absolutely very good for value of money if anyone wants to buy g 60 for camera then don't go for it because there is no much difference in between the camera of g 40 fusion which is very very good as seen by value for money..

Camera: normal mode is good but not great. Pro setting is also average. High resolution pictures are superb. Front camera is good too but all cameras lack sharpness in low light conditions.
Battery: I'm heavy user and belive me I'm getting 19 hrs battery backup with normal usage and 6 to 7 hrs with continuous usage.
Display: it's big in our hands and will get used to it ...

4290,5,"Value for money I would say.
The battery is very long-lasting.
The camera is Excellent.
No bloatware is used by moto and that's the biggest advantage you will ever get.
I request moto not to use bloatware in the future also.
Overall this is an amazing phone by Moto.
I have been into the moto family for the past 5 years. First Bought 1 phone for my dad, After seeing the performance, I ordered another one for myself.

Battery- 4000 is enough
Display - 6.5

5491,5,"I choosed Motorola big battery, 108 camera, NFC , 128 ROM, though I've been looking for 256ROM. Motorola was the only mobile at reasonable price to fit my needs, ROM can be extended to 1TB, which is great!
The only thing I do not like is the software! I would love to see more options/configuration. Just like in Realme mobiles UI software. Yes I used Realme mobiles till now and Realme UI is much faster with lots of options and other settings which I liked more. I hope to see some updates soon!"

Excellent phone for students.

Battery backup is exceptional.

Camera is above average (software optimization is required for camera)

Stock-android like UI is very good and smooth.(no lag till today).

Gaming experience is also very good.

CONS:- Missing magnetic sensor
Display id IPS LCD only(Amoled must have been provided for this price).

NOTE:- use GCAM for better quality photos."
5497,5,"Awesome device at this price range. I've bought this as a secondary mobile and it perfectly met my expectations. So go with your preference or requirements.

I have had a great experience with Moto One Power (4GB | 64GB). Such a magnificent device it is. Unfortunately that is not in stock now. That drove and influenced me to have a Moto mobile again.

Clean UI, No non-sense advertisements like most of the other brands, No bloatware, Good RAM management, Fantabulous Moto gestures.

1. Charging time is fast courtesy the 20W charger.

4. Pure Android experience.

Feels like a solid phone with a long battery life and a vibrant camera. The interface is clean and Motorola don't load any spam apps so the experience of using this phone is enhanced. The perennial gesture features on Moto phones to turn on the torch or the camera instead of the tedious unlocking or swiping is a big win.

Only downside is the absence of a Gallery folder to access the pics and the lack of 5G connectivity.
Otherwise it's a phone built for more than what you'...

5623,5,"Camera is nice.. I like natural colours so it works for me. It also has a front camera. But macro isn't as good as Samsung's.
Glossy back looks attractive but easily gets fingerprints and smudges on.so a back cover is a must. It would look better with a matt finish. Phone is quite clear and no extra app."

5763,5,"Pros and Cons after a month of usage.

Pros.

I find this phone to be really good, and just the type that meets my requirements.
Before buying it I had consulted many reviews, and most recommended this but with caveats on camera and ""UI Experience"".
So my review:
Pros:
The phone is really well built, yes plastic but not cheap at all. It has a shiny finish. Screen is big, really big. Screen is also very bright, so no issues on that front. Battery is optimum, works 30-42 hrs on one...

Pros
1) camera is decent if not good

3) sound: a little bit improvement is required but it is good enough
4) 120 refresh rate gives you a better experience
Cons

this phone is epic for a new, first time Android user who has basic functions like call, email, surfing and some writing to do..

The display is good - not AMOLED but decent.

The screen is LARGE - document viewing, YouTube, social - fly through.

JUST GO FOR IT . MOTO HAVE REGAINED ITS PLACE IN MARKET. I Think G60 will make a remarkable place same like moto RAZR. Check the pic , it's just normal click and no edit , one shot ."

6146,5,Good phone and performance also ok... fingerprint is slow but ok . value for money
6147,5,"Front camera is much better than rear camera.

6149,5,"Nothing can neat it's quality, performance, rugged build inside and outside. It's the. Best in segment and high rated value fir money. I am impresses with its 120 hz refresh rates which is far superior compared to any other world renowned brands. I would suggest just go fir it without second thought."
6150,5,"1. Processoring is superb with instant
2. Battery is awesome stays longer
3.camera is superb but needs mild improvement it's not as expected but in this amount it's more sufficient..bcoz 108mp is in mobile...so its not digital camera like DSLR to show images as equal to 108mp
4.mild heating issues I have found ...but not permanently...heating may go after sometimes unlike other mobiles

Screen size is bigger than normal, which looks odd. Good for those who like big screen size phones. Performance wise ok.

After one month of usage:
Excellent performance, battery life is good. Now used to its big screen and other smart phone looks very small. Value for money. Used to its weight and now Fully satisfied."

6228,5,Nice phone
6229,5,Value for money. Good performance. No lag while using apps. Overall an excellent phone for this price range.
6230,5,This is one of the best phones in this budget. It looks cool as its m logo is the fingerprint scanner. Many games can't use the full screen as it has a 6.68 inch big display. I played games for more than three hours and it consumed only 27 percent battery. Camera is also good. Over all it is great
6231,5,Nice
6232,5,Good
6233,5,Super
6234,5,Loved the product. Good battery life . Takes around 1.5 hours to charge from 0-100% which is bit of a downside. The display is pretty good and smooth with the 120hz refresh rate. And as for the camera you can download the Google cam version and it is significantly better. Have been using the product for 3 months now. Got 2 security updates as well. Without a doubt best VFM phone under 20k for the stock android experience.
6235,5,"Good performance
Awesome phone
Mind blowing purchase
Tnks Flipkart"
6236,5,"Everything is good, value for money phone"
6237,5,This mobile has the best battery. I charged the mobile only once at the start of the day and I used it's without giving rest to it. It lasted for almost 14hrs. Mobile was started to heat not because of over work it is because of climate. Whole day mobile data is on and brightness is 80 to 100 percent. This mobile performance is good. Camera is satisfying. But the packing was not good
6238,5,Super performance

6278,5,Couldn't ask for more.
6279,5,"I have purchased this mobile 1 week earlier & since then using it. The first thing that impressed me is the 🔋 battery backup. Even after continuous using the phone, very minimum battery % consumed & last almost one & half day.
The phone is little bit heavier & much tall in shape which gives a prominent in-hand feel, holding the device.
Camera 📷 quality I wouldn't say it's the best but in this price level 108 mega pixel is much justified & pictures captured are much more than average. Equipe...

6281,5,"Writing review after 7 days of use. Good phone. Doesn't lag. Back camera is not loke 108 mp, could have boon better. Anyway moto phones are not super camera phones. Front camera is excellent with flash. Battery drains faster. My old phone, Moto One Power had 5000 battery and it lasted for approx 3 days. This has 6000 battery but need to charge it on 2nd day. Looks like 4000 battery. I am happy at this purchase which costed around 12.5 k"

Please be aware that I have jumped from a Moto G4 to Moto g(60). This is a 6-year gap so the technological advances are amazing.
I agree with all the pros mentioned in the reviews but I do have a minor complaint - The fingerprint sensor

Camera pics as per his usage is very good, but he aint a regular clicker so cant say whats good for him and whats not.

Things that he is bit not happy is weight ( tried to tell him its coz of battery)"

Pros - Good battery life. I dont do too much video calls or youtubing. Lasts more than 48hrs easily.
Build feels sturdy. The Moto feature are a bonus.
Stock Android is biggest advantage.

Cons : 1.Size , it is massive large.
2. No compass sensor , not sure why Moto does not include one in their phones.
Not a con but a moot point - Camera bump.

Overall works well , no lags and is smooth. Camera department could have been better. The macro mode is good tho...

Loudspeaker is weak. But the phone has really good sound output on Bluetooth earphones/headphones

6852,5,"I have been using MotoG60 for a week and here are my thoughts!
Moto did great job in this product, its perfectly tweaked with multiple gestures this phone is great for people whos hands are huge(palms of people who are generally above 6 feet) It has front flash too! it has NFC chip you can do tap to pay at terminals! useful for people who are working like use WhatsApp, browsing and pdf scanning!

It doesn't have electronic compass! Its not good for travelers or people who rely on Google map...
